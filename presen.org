* Physical Symbol Systems Hypothesis

Alan Newell, Harbert Simon, 1975

1975 ACM Turing Award lecture

Tries to describe the field of *Computer Science* as an instance of *empirical science*

** Laws of Qualitative Structure

+ Science is driven by *qualitative* hypotheses
  which causes a *Paradigm Shift*
  + Cell Doctrine in Biology
    + The basic building block of living organism *should be a cell*.
      + What is a cell? (studied later)
  + Plate tectonics in Geology
    + The basic building block of earth clust *should be a moving plate*.
      + Why and how? (studied later)
      + Evidence is found everywhere now
  + Germ theory of Disease
    + *Most* diseases are caused by multiplication of germs inside body
    + Not claimin it is always so
  + Atomism in Chemistry
    + The basic building block of matter *should be an atom.*
+ *What is the equivalent for Computer Science?*

** Qualitative Hypothesis for CS

#+begin_quote
*The Physical Symbol System Hypothesis*: A physical symbol system has the
 *necessary* and *suffcient* means for general intelligent action.
#+end_quote

+ Physical Symbol System ::
     The system is realizable/engineered. i.e. human, computer
+ Physical Symbol ::
  + Not just human symbol systems (words like "cat"); include machine symbols.
  + Physical patterns in the real world. ( e.g. patterns that are common in the visual depiction of "1"s)

** Symbols

#+begin_quote
A physical symbol system consists of a set of entities, called symbols, which are physical patterns
#+end_quote

(not specify what kind of patterns they are, but something like the patterns in "1" or ☺)

#+begin_src C

static *void A;                      /* A is a symbol */
static *void B;                      /* B is another symbol */

&A;                             /* The content/value disignated by the symbol A */
                                /* We don't know what it is (hence *void),  */
                                /* but it is *some* pattern */

*A;                             /* The symbol itself */
#+end_src

#+begin_src lisp

(defvar a)
(defvar b)

a                  ; a is the value of the symbol 'a
'a                 ; 'a is a symbol (quoted)
(quote a)          ; 'a is an abbreviation of an expression (quote a)

;; Using a symbol automatically inserts an entity in a global symbol table.
;; This information is removed in C after compilation

(do-all-symbols (s)
   (print s))      ; Loop for all symbols defined in the current environment
                   ; No equivalent in C...
#+end_src

** Expression, or Symbol Structure

#+begin_quote
... physical patterns that can occur as components of another type of entity
called an expression (or symbol structure).
#+end_quote

#+begin_src C

*void plus(*void a, *void b);     /* plus is a symbol (pointer to the compiled instructions) */

void* exp[3] = {plus, a, b} ;      /* an expression containing plus, A, B */

#+end_src

#+begin_src lisp

;; Symbolic Expresssion / S-Expression / S-EXP / sexp, quoted

'(+ a b)

#+end_src

** Process (== Procedure, Functions)

#+begin_quote
Besides these structures, the system also contains a collection of processes
that *operate on expressions to produce other expressions*.
#+end_quote

#+begin_src C

*void concat(*void a, *void b){
   /* omitted */
}

void* exp1[3] = {plus, a, b} ;      /* an expression containing plus, A, B */
void* exp2[3] = {plus, c, d} ;      /* an expression containing plus, A, B */

void* exp3[6] = concat(exp1, exp2);
// --> {plus, a, b, plus, c, d}   i.e. concat produces a new expression.

#+end_src

#+begin_src lisp

(append '(+ a b) '(+ c d)) ;; -> '(+ a b + c d)

#+end_src

** Essential requirements of symbols / sexps

#+begin_quote
*Designation*. An expression designates an object if, given the expression, the system can either
affect the object itself or behave in ways dependent on the object. (Designate = bind, pointer reference)
#+end_quote

: *B = A                          /* B designates A */

E.g. complex patterns in images, or complex patterns in motor activity e.g. walk

#+begin_quote
*Interpretation*. The system can interpret an expression if the expression designates a process
and if, given the expression, the system can *carry out* the process. (Carry out = execute, run)
#+end_quote

Carry out =(+ a b)= : Follow the function pointer and compute the value of =a + b=

** Essential requirements of sexps : completeness / closure

#+begin_quote
*Arbitraryness*: A symbol may be used to designate any expression.
#+end_quote

-> Can be rephrased in modern terms as: There is no types in "ideas"; Can be repurposed freely.

#+begin_src C
void* exp3[6] = concat(exp1, exp2); // exp1, exp2, exp3 are themselves symbols.
*exp3 = A;                          // It can be re-assigned to just a single symbol.
#+end_src

#+begin_src lisp
(setf exp3 A)
#+end_src

** Other essential requirements of sexps :

+ There exist *expressions that designate every process* of which the machine is capable.
  + This obviously suggests the existence of =EVAL= function.
  + In case of planning, it is PDDL. (A machine restricted to a regular grammar)
+ There exist *processes for creating any expression* and for modifying them in any ways.
  + Again, EVAL.
+ *Stableness*: Expressions are stable.
  + once created they will continue to exist until explicitly modified or deleted.
+ *Unbounded* : The number of expressions is essentially unbounded.
  + Dynamically allocated memory; Not common in the earliest computers.

#+begin_quote
The type of system we have just defined is not unfamiliar to computer scientists. It bears a strong family
resemblance to sit general purpose computers. If a symbol manipulation language, such as LISP, is taken
as defining a machine, then *the kinship becomes truly brotherly*.
#+end_quote

This architecture is still a good model of today's computers.

** The Physical Symbol System Hypothesis.

#+begin_quote
A physical symbol system has the *necessary* and *suffcient* means for general intelligent action.
#+end_quote

+ Necessary :: Any intelligent system will be proved to be a physical symbol system.
+ Sufficent :: If you have a physical symbol system of sufficient size, you can build an AI.

** The Physical Symbol System Hypothesis.

#+begin_quote
A physical symbol system has the *necessary* and *suffcient* means for general intelligent action.
#+end_quote

+ This is a *qualitative* hypothesis.
  + It does not go into details.
  + It does not specify *what* is designated by a symbol,
    + /cell/ is not strictly defined in cell hypothesis. Only later the
      existence of nucleus, protoplasm, membrane are revealed.
+ This is an *empirical* hypothesis.
  + You can build a symbolic system and test its intelligence.
  + You can test an intelligent being (human) and see if it has symbols.
  + You can build an intelligent system without symbols and disprove the hypothesis.
  + Just as *Germ hypothesis*, perhaps only *most* or *some* class of systems may satisfy PSSH.

** The development (history) of PSSH:

Just briefly

+ *Formal Logic*: "symbol game" w/o meaning. Mechanical operations on highly abstracted expressions
+ *Turing machines*: Defined what is computable. Defined what is information.
  + I/O are 0/1 strings. Data are *stable*
  + The tape has infinite length; *unbounded*
  + Still lacks meaning == *lacks designation* (1st requirement of symbols)
  + Lacks designation == can run a process but cannot designate a process
+ *Stored program* (After Eniac): In-memory programs, not cards
  + program = data. Program pointers *can designate a process*
+ *List processing: LISP*
  + Dynamic memory allocations + lots of pointer operations (cons cell)
  + Defines new functions dynamically (lambdas)
  + Produced a model of designation; Finally formed today's symbol manipulation
  + All tecnhical requirements were satisfied already, but it wasn't until LISP
    that designation+interpretation is considered as the core concept

Theory + Hardware + Ideas were essential

** After PSSH

How to prove PSSH? *Empirically*

#+begin_container-fluid
#+begin_row-fluid
#+begin_span6
*Sufficiency*: Let's build an AI using LISP

Germ theory:
+ Find a disease, then identify the germ.
+ Found many germs, then study the commonarities.
PSSH: Find an intelligent tasks, then write a program.
+ Chess, puzzle, ...
+ Commonarities found: *Heuristic Search Hypothesis* (later)
#+end_span6
#+begin_span6
*Necessity*: Let's find symbols in human (*Cognitive Science*)

+ Observe human behaviors in intelligent tasks
  + Thinking aloud (thinking while uttering one's thought)
+ Came to agree that human have symbols (short term memory, chunks...)
#+end_span6
#+end_row-fluid
#+end_container-fluid

-----

Other evidences: lack of competing hypothesis.
+ Others lack the sufficiency criteria; lacks the attempt to *engineer* it

Skipped: Essentially telling that *problem solving is a heuristic search*

* Heuristic Search Hypothesis                                      :noexport:

With PSSH, systems can answer a problem. What /is/ a problem?

Plato / Socrates: Found it difficult how to even /come up with/ problems, let alone solving it.

# #+begin_quote
# Meno: And how will you inquire, Socrates,
# into that which you know not? What will you
# put forth as the subject of inquiry? And if you
# find what you want, how will you ever know that
# this is what you did not know?
# #+end_quote

Modern definition of problems:

#+begin_quote
To state a problem is to designate

+ a test for a class of symbol structures (solutions of the problem)
+ a generator of symbol structures (potential solutions).

To solve a problem is to generate a structure, using (2), that satisfies the test of (1).
#+end_quote

#+begin_larger
i.e. *it allows to enumerate & test = search.*
#+end_larger

** Heuristic Search Hypothesis

#+begin_quote
*Heuristic Search Hypothesis*. The solutions to
problems are represented as symbol structures.
A PSS exercises its intelligence in problem solving by search - that is, by
generating and progressively modifying symbol
structures until it produces a solution structure.
#+end_quote

#+begin_larger
i.e. *it is solved by enumerate & test = search.*
#+end_larger

However, in practical systems, the efficiency matters.
Chess players largely prune nodes. So should other intelligence.

** Conditions for Intelligence

+ Do not resort to brute-force search.
+ Extract information from the problem to guide the search
  + test (e.g. goals) and the generator structure (e.g. environment) of the problem
+ Intelligent problems != Large problems.
  + Intelligent problems are exploitable by intelligent systems for minimizing the search effort.

In a chaotic environment (no exploitable information), no intelligence can exist (similar to no free lunch theorem)
